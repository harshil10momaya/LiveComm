The package submission is titled REAL-TIME VIDEO &amp; AUDIO CONFERENCING
SYSTEM. The system enables bi-directional video and audio transmission between multiple
clients over a network.
The program starts with the server initializing sockets for both video and audio streaming.
Clients connect to the server, establishing a real-time communication channel for seamless video
and voice interaction. The system allows multiple users to communicate simultaneously.
Key Concepts Used:
 Multithreading: Enables concurrent handling of multiple clients.
 Socket Programming: Facilitates communication between server and clients over TCP.
 Serialization(Fragmentation): pickle is used for video frame transmission.
 Audio Processing: pyaudio is used for capturing, transmitting, and playing real-time
audio.
 Video Processing: OpenCV is used for webcam access and frame rendering.
 TCP Communication: Ensures reliable and ordered transmission of video and audio
data.
 Packetization: Video and audio streams are broken into smaller packets for transmission.
 Flow Control &amp; Congestion Handling: Prevents data loss and ensures smooth media
streaming.
 Error Detection &amp; Recovery: Mechanisms to handle packet loss and maintain stable
connections.
 Data Streaming: Continuous transmission of video and audio without buffering delays.
 Broadcasting: The server distributes video and audio streams to all connected clients.
Modules Used:
socket, cv2 (OpenCV), pyaudio, pickle, struct, threading, numpy.
Future Scope &amp; Improvements:
 Enhanced UI: Implementing a graphical interface using Tkinter or PyQt.
 Encryption: Adding E2EE for secure transmission using TLS/SSL.
 Screen Sharing &amp; Chat Features: Extending functionality beyond just video and audio.
 Use UDP for Video Streaming: Optimizing video/audio synchronization and latency.
This system serves as a foundation for a Google Meet-like video conferencing solution,
providing a real-time communication experience over the network.
